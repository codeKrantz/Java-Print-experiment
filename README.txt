This code was inspired by an idea I had when I siwithced from using Python to Java in my progaming II class.

I kept wanting to type "print" but this function is called System.out.println() in Java

The reason I want to make this is to beable to uplode the code to replit where fo some reason it never suggest System.out.println()
as a short cut command/function.
